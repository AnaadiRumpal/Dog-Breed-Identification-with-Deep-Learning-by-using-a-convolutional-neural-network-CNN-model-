# Dog-Breed-Identification-with-Deep-Learning-by-using-a-convolutional-neural-network-CNN-model-
In this project, I embarked on an exciting journey to build a machine learning model capable of identifying different breeds of dogs. 
This task, known as multi-class image classification, involved using data from the Kaggle dog breed identification competition. The dataset comprised over 10,000 labeled images spanning 120 different dog breeds. Because of GPU constraints 1000 images were used to train and validate the model. The ultimate goal was to leverage deep learning techniques, particularly transfer learning, to classify these breeds accurately.
 
Steps Involved in the Project:
## 1.	Data Preparation
### Downloading the Dataset:
I obtained the dataset from Kaggle, which included images and corresponding labels for different dog breeds.
### Organizing the Data: 
The data was organized into a structure suitable for training a machine learning model. This included creating directories for training, validation, and testing sets.
###	Preprocessing the Images:
####	Resizing and Normalizing: 
Images were resized to a uniform size of 224x224 pixels, and pixel values were normalized.
####	Data Augmentation: 
Techniques like rotation, zoom, and flip were used to augment the data and enhance the model's generalization capability.
####	Conversion to Tensors: 
The images were converted into tensors using TensorFlow’s tf.data.Dataset API. This facilitated efficient loading and preprocessing of data, including batching and shuffling to ensure the model received varied inputs during training.
####	Function for Image Preprocessing:
#####	Read and Convert Image: 
A function was created to read an image file, convert it into a tensor, resize it to 224x224, and normalize the pixel values.
#####	Batches Creation: 
The dataset was divided into batches of 32 images to optimize memory usage and computation efficiency during training.
###	Data Visualization: 
A function was created to visualize batches of data, helping to understand the underlying structure and distribution of images and labels.
## Model Selection and Transfer Learning
Given the complexity of the task, transfer learning was employed. This technique leverages pre-trained models on large datasets to fine-tune on our specific task.
### Choosing a Pre-trained Model: 
I selected a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model from TensorFlow Hub, specifically mobilenet_v2_130_224.
###	Customizing the Model:
####	Model Layers: 
The final layers of the pre-trained model were replaced with layers specific to our classification task, including a global average pooling layer, dense layers, and a softmax activation layer for multi-class classification.
####	Compiling the Model: 
The model was compiled using the Adam optimizer and the categorical cross-entropy loss function, appropriate for multi-class classification tasks.
## 3.	Model Training
###	Training the Model: 
The model was trained on the training set, with a portion of the data set aside as the validation set to monitor the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
###	Using Callbacks:
####	TensorBoard Callback: 
TensorBoard was used to visualize metrics such as loss and accuracy during training. This was achieved by adding a TensorBoard callback to the training process.
####	Early Stopping Callback: 
Early stopping was implemented to halt training when the model's performance on the validation set stopped improving, preventing overfitting and saving computational resources.
## 4.	Model Evaluation and Deployment
###	Evaluation Metrics:
	Accuracy: The primary metric for evaluating how well the model classified the dog breeds was accuracy.
	Visualization: The model's predictions were visualized to understand its performance better.
###	Model Deployment: The trained model was prepared for deployment, making it accessible for practical use cases, such as identifying dog breeds from user-uploaded images.
## Conclusion
The end-to-end dog vision project was a comprehensive exercise in applying deep learning techniques to a practical problem. By following a structured approach from data preparation to model deployment, we successfully built a model capable of classifying different dog breeds with high accuracy. The project not only demonstrated the power of transfer learning but also underscored the importance of careful data handling, thorough evaluation, and effective deployment strategies. The skills and insights gained from this project are broadly applicable to other machine learning endeavors, paving the way for future explorations in the field.
